# RBRO - Windows Shared File Closing Event Detection

This project is a prototype implementation demonstrating how to use WINDOWS embedded feature called OPENFILES to detect if a shared file
or folder is closed

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

Visual Studio 2017 running as Administrator

## Running the demo

Make sure that the project is built to x64 on project properties page

Run (F5)

## Findstr Command Arguments

findstr [/b] [/e] [/l | /r] [/s] [/i] [/x] [/v] [/n] [/m] [/o] [/p] [/f:<File>] [/c:<String>] [/g:<File>] [/d:<DirList>] [/a:<ColorAttribute>] [/off[line]] <Strings> [<Drive>:][<Path>]<FileName>[ ...]

### Parameters

Parameter	Description
/b	Matches the text pattern if it is at the beginning of a line.  
/e	Matches the text pattern if it is at the end of a line.  
/l	Processes search strings literally. 
/r	Processes search strings as regular expressions. This is the default setting.  
/s	Searches the current directory and all subdirectories.  
/i	Ignores the case of the characters when searching for the string.  
/x	Prints lines that match exactly.  
/v	Prints only lines that do not contain a match.  
/n	Prints the line number of each line that matches.  
/m	Prints only the file name if a file contains a match.  
/o	Prints character offset before each matching line.  
/p	Skips files with non-printable characters.  
/off[line]	Does not skip files that have the offline attribute set.  
/f:<File>	Gets a file list from the specified file.  
/c:<String>	Uses the specified text as a literal search string.  
/g:<File>	Gets search strings from the specified file.  
/d:<DirList>	Searches the specified list of directories. Each directory must be separated with a semicolon (;), for example dir1;dir2;dir3.  
/a:<ColorAttribute>	Specifies color attributes with two hexadecimal digits. Type color /? for additional information.  
<Strings>	Specifies the text to search for in FileName. Required.  
[<Drive>:][][ ...]	Specifies the location and file or files to search. At least one file name is required.  
/?	Displays Help at the command prompt.  


All findstr command-line options must precede Strings and FileName in the command string.
Regular expressions use both literal characters and metacharacters to find patterns of text, rather than exact strings of characters. A literal character is a character that does not have a special meaning in the regular-expression syntaxâ€”it matches an occurrence of that character. For example, letters and numbers are literal characters. A metacharacter is a symbol with special meaning (an operator or delimiter) in the regular-expression syntax.

The following table lists the metacharacters that findstr accepts.

Metacharacter	Value
.	Wildcard: any character
*	Repeat: zero or more occurrences of the previous character or class
^	Line position: beginning of the line
$	Line position: end of the line
[class]	Character class: any one character in a set
[^class]	Inverse class: any one character not in a set
[x-y]	Range: any characters within the specified range
\x	Escape: literal use of a metacharacter x
\<string	Word position: beginning of the word
string>	Word position: end of the word
